# Julia_DataAnalysis
Not a complete Julia package, I just put some files here that I make while starting to use Julia for data analysis.

## fast_tsne.jl - wrapper for Barnes-hut t-SNE
 
 t-SNE, the C++ implementation of Barnes-Hut accelerated t-SNE, and the Matlab wrapper on which this code is based were developed and provided by Laurens van der Maaten (Delft University of Technology)
 In order for it to work, you will need to compile the source code provided by Laurens van der Maaten.
